RSVP by Oct. 16 to Jackie Paladino Mastro at QQChevy57@aol.com.Dec. 2--Author Kate DiCamillo has a precise, practical response to acclaim. Consider her reaction to the New York Times review of her latest novel, \"Beverly, Right Here,\" with the headline it \"may be her finest yet.\"\\n\"I read it and then I forget about it willfully,\" DiCamillo, 55, said in an interview. \"What I\\'m supposed to be doing is telling the story. I can let it in for a minute, then I have to totally let it go.\"\\nThat unpretentious style helps explain her staying power. Readers have connected with DiCamillo, who grew up in Clermont, since \"Because of Winn-Dixie\" came out in 2000. Her Friday appearance at Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park is an event for readers, young and older, who treasure her beautifully direct style, her yearning characters and her wonder in small things.\\n\"Beverly, Right Here\" can be seen as the third novel in a trilogy about three girls who became unlikely friends. The poignant \"Raymie Nightingale\" from 2016 was followed by 2018\\'s \"Louisiana\\'s Way Home.\"\\n\"Raymie is kind of the kid I was,\" DiCamillo said. \"Louisiana is kind of the kid I could have been had things been a little more dire. Beverly is who I wanted to be in the world. She\\'s so tough, but yet she\\'s also tender, and I think it takes a lot of bravery to be tender. That\\'s why I kept coming back to try to figure out how to be brave that way myself.\"\\nAt 14 and mourning the loss of her dog, Beverly runs away from home. She goes to work in a restaurant, moves in with a widow and befriends a convenience store clerk named Elmer. The novel is set in Florida, but DiCamillo, who lives in Minneapolis, doesn\\'t come here for research.\\n\"I carry Florida with me,\" she said. \"I think so much of what the book is about is Beverly learning to let herself be loved. She\\'s real capable of loving. It\\'s a different thing entirely to let herself be loved. That\\'s biographical for me.\"\\nTwice DiCamillo has won the prestigious Newbery Medal for children\\'s literature (\"The Tale of Despereaux\" in 2004 and \"Flora & Ulysses\" in 2014). Her spare style may look effortless, but it isn\\'t.\\n\"I want to make it so you that you can see through it,\" she said. \"The way to do that is rewrite it and rewrite it and rewrite it until it\\'s clear, until it\\'s stripped down. If I rewrite enough, I feel like I can make it clear and spare, stripping it away to get to the truth of the thing.\"\\nWith DiCamillo, a lot of the writing is between the lines, about what\\'s left unsaid.\\n\"That\\'s where the reader comes in,\" she said. \"That leaves the door open for you and me together in the story, if I leave those spaces. It\\'s what I\\'m always trying to figure out about E.B. White, how his words seem to matter more than anybody else\\'s words. He\\'s using the same words we\\'re all using. It must be that stripped-away quality, his heart is resting more on each word, and that\\'s what I\\'m always trying to do.\"\\nIn \"Beverly, Right Here,\" the author\\'s heart rests in the description of a shade of blue or a bird outside a kitchen door. That wonder, she says, \"is what keeps me alive. Beverly and I are similar in that respect. That thing about all the beauty, if we are willing to get out of our own heads and look at the world, that beauty can sustain you.\"\\nDiCamillo even makes Elmer\\'s acne beautiful.\\n\"It\\'s not hard to make Elmer beautiful,\" she said, \"because Elmer is beautiful himself.\"\\nDuring her Central Florida stop, DiCamillo hopes to see classmates from Clermont Elementary School and Clermont High School as well as former co-workers from Walt Disney World Resort.\\nShe is working on a line edit of a novel that will be out in 2021. Her \"Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane\" has inspired an opera. Two of her books, \"Flora & Ulysses\" and \"The Tiger Rising,\" are becoming films.\\nNext year, \"Because of Winn-Dixie\" will mark its 20th anniversary. \"It has a ton of meaning for me,\" she said. \"It opened the door to everything for me.\"\\nShe initially resists the adjective prolific. \"I feel like I move so slowly,\" DiCamllo said. \"I don\\'t go quickly, but it\\'s been 20 years now, and it\\'s a lot of books, 25, 26 books, so yes, OK, I guess I\\'m prolific.\"\\nShe is also one of the finest writers ever to come out of Central Florida. But we won\\'t linger over that, so she can let it go quickly. We don\\'t want to slow her down.\\nWhat: The author who grew up in Clermont presents and signs copies of her new novel, \"Beverly, Right Here\"; the event is sponsored by Writer\\'s Block Bookstore\\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 6\\nWhere: Trinity Preparatory School, 5700 Trinity Prep Lane, Winter Park\\nTickets: Start at $20 for one seat and includes a book\\n(c)2019 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)\\nVisit The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.) at www.OrlandoSentinel.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.Think \"Peace Corps\" or \"VISTA,\" and what comes to mind?\\nService missions such as those have been enthusiastically supported for decades and have provided opportunities that are both vital to those who benefit directly and life-changing for those who serve. These are voluntary, limited opportunities that provide good for millions.\\nThere\\'s a debate going on already about whether the United States should bring back the military draft. So, should the nation broaden that debate to explore a mandatory requirement for service missions as well?\\nThe answer is a resounding \"yes.\"\\nMandatory service, here, you say, in America?\\nAmerica needs to make a commitment to universal public service. Consider the stories of those who have embraced service, served well and have found their own lives profoundly affected. Here\\'s one.\\nMegan Coffee, a young woman from New Jersey, interrupted a fellowship on infectious diseases at the University of California to go to Haiti following a devastating earthquake there. Because Haiti\\'s largest hospital needed someone to run the tuberculosis unit, Coffee - with no plans and no place to stay - volunteered. Working 12-hour days for no pay, seven days a week, she was often the only doctor. She worked in a \"center\" that consisted of three tents in a parking lot with only sporadic electricity to rely on.\\nCoffee\\'s service to Haiti was remarkable, but so was the impact of that service on her. After returning to the states, she earned a degree at Harvard\\'s medical school and went to Oxford University to continue her specialized study of diseases such as malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis. She earned a doctorate in mathematical modeling of epidemics - work she used to produce scholarly articles on the spread of AIDS in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\\n\"I met so many people dying of AIDS there and I felt I just couldn\\'t look into their eyes and ask them questions from a survey,\" Coffee told The Star-Ledger in 2010. \"I had to help them.\"\\nIn reflecting on her choices, Coffee said she was able to pursue \"the pure practice of medicine - applying what you know directly to people who need your help - there\\'s nothing like it. ... It\\'s also nice seeing people live because of what you\\'ve done.\"\\nThinking seriously about mandatory service now is important because a bipartisan congressional panel - the National Commission on Military, National and Public\\nService - is undertaking a comprehensive review of all forms of service to the country, holding hearings from coast to coast and planning to issue its final report in a matter of months.\\nPresident John Kennedy expanded federal government support for voluntary service programs when he created the Peace Corps in 1961. Several hundred thousand volunteers have served in more than 140 countries working on public health, education, information technology, water quality, housing and environmental preservation. Their efforts to advance world peace and friendship continue to provide sources of hope.\\nAmeriCorps, the legacy of President Lyndon Johnson, and VISTA, reflecting President Bill Clinton\\'s vision - now combined - enable volunteers to contribute their skills and talents to change the lives of people in communities across this country. Thousands of individuals annually make the commitment to tutor and mentor young people, build affordable housing, assist veterans and military families, provide health services, run after-school programs, help communities respond to disasters, and build the capacity of nonprofit organizations. With many millions of Americans living in poverty, the value of their work can\\'t be overestimated. A demographic analysis from 2017, collected by the Corporation for National and Community Service, said 77.4 million Americans volunteered to meet the pressing needs of their fellow citizens, serving 6.9 billion hours.\\nBritani Lee-Carmichael, an Air Force veteran, is one of them. She chooses to work with those she knows best: veterans who also served the country: \"As a veteran, I had my own troubles,\" she wrote in 2016. \"It was then that I was informed about AmeriCorps and jumped at the opportunity to help give back to my fellow comrades. ... It is not very often that a military person will expose their struggles to someone else. We are taught to hold our heads up high and fix the issues ourselves. Veterans not only need an ear to listen, but also resources to help them in their daily lives.\"\\nTHE NEED FOR NATIONAL SERVICE\\nThere appears to be no widely held expectation of service in the U.S., however, and no culture to nurture it. As a result, military, national and public service is currently the exception rather than the rule. In a country of more than 320 million, the potential for service is largely untapped. Just over 28% of millennials reported volunteering in 2017, performing roughly 1.5 billion hours of community service. Good, but not good enough.\\nThe call of national military service currently falls on a concentrated group of Americans and has since the draft ended in 1973. Mandatory service for all, with options to choose how to serve, could broaden participation in - and increase the fairness of - military service. At present, only 1% of the total U.S. population fights the nation\\'s wars.\\nMoreover, the U.S. Army is reportedly several thousand troops short, even after spending an extra $200 million on bonuses and lowering standards to let in more recruits who may have conduct or health issues. More than two-thirds of young adults do not qualify for military service because of poor physical fitness or other issues such as drug use, according to the Army.\\nThe nation needs individuals with skills in fields involving medicine, dentistry, nursing, language, computers, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Providing education and training to expand the nation\\'s civilian and military service corps and to recruit people trained with these skills will strengthen the nation\\'s preparedness, enhance its well-being and provide career opportunities for young people after their service is completed.\\nThe New York Times asked readers recently, \"Do you think one year of public service should be mandatory for all Americans?\" Fully 73% said yes (12% said no and 15% didn\\'t know).\\nThe idea has resonance. A number of prominent Americans have stated their support for the idea of mandatory public service. Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal proposed the idea in 2014 \"to create a new rite of passage into adulthood and forge a renewed sense of citizenship.\"\\nA conservative opinion writer for the New York Times, Ross Douthat, has weighed in, too: He sees \"an age of despair\" taking shape in America, given the rise in deaths from suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, due, at least in part, to an economic and spiritual crisis, he says, to a decaying social trust, \"a meaning deficit, a loss of purpose and optimism and direction, a gently dehumanizing drift.\"\\nThe National Commission on Military, National and Public Service has heard from witnesses about the stasis of youth, the restlessness, uncertainty, absence of direction, even boredom and, too, the apparent absence of a shared national ethic among young and not-so-young alike. The commission is looking for ways to foster national cohesion and provide avenues for young people to find meaning and purpose, and to meet pressing national needs.\\nInstitutionalizing public service as a national responsibility is a productive way to think about this. It\\'s less about charity and more about a kind of reciprocity, providing a means for young people in particular to find paths to \"earn\" their citizenship, perhaps to cultivate future vocations, but certainly to see service as a way to help improve the lives of others and, by doing so, add value to their own.\\nMandatory or not, those choosing nonmilitary public service should receive ample training and support much as those doing military service receive. One thought is to create a Public Service Corps program, similar to the Reserve Officers Training Corps - aka ROTC - that would offer scholarships and special training to students at schools and colleges in exchange for their work in national service. We need to provide and support programs to forgive student loans and provide other incentives - scholarship support, stipends, hiring preferences - for young people so that they can serve in areas of greatest national need without undue personal sacrifice.\\nAnd we should create a culture of service by providing encouragement for service in K-12 schools and provide frameworks to support service in the years following secondary and postsecondary school.\\nKennedy implored Americans to embrace civic action and public service, as most of us know, when he told his fellow citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\"\\nWith bipartisan political leadership - and, before long, public endorsement - we can hope that the national commission will acknowledge the proper role for government to support and sustain universal service and recommend that the nation step up and mandate it.\\nLinda Stamato is co-director of the Center for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy of Rutgers University.Sep. 29--SAN JOSE -- The Sharks are figuring out what kind of player they have after two weeks of training camp. Yurtaykin is still adjusting to life in a new country half a world away from his hometown in Russia.\\n\"He\\'s got good speed, he\\'s a good player,\" Sharks forward Timo Meier said of Yurtaykin. \"Doesn\\'t speak a word of English, but we have fun with him. He\\'s working hard and the boys like being on the ice with him.\"\\nSo far, Yurtaykin has shown enough promise to remain on the Sharks\\' roster just four days before the start of the regular season. Although changes can be made between now and Tuesday afternoon -- the deadline for teams to submit opening day 23-man rosters to the NHL -- it looks like Yurtaykin, 22, will be with the Sharks to start the year.\\nYurtaykin was on a line with Joe Thornton and Marcus Sorensen for Saturday\\'s practice, and that trio might be in the lineup Sunday when the Sharks face the Vegas Golden Knights at T-Mobile Arena in their final preseason game.\\n\"He\\'s come a long way,\" Thornton said of Yurtaykin. \"He\\'s still learning English, so it must be real tough on the kid.\\n\"As the weeks go on, I think he\\'s understanding a little bit more. I don\\'t think he knew a lick before he came over here. But he\\'s trying. He\\'s understanding a few more hockey terms. I\\'m sure it\\'ll get better week-to-week.\\n\"Me and Marcus have played together for a while now, so we\\'re familiar. But taking a young kid like that, teaching him some English, teaching him some fun words and playing hard for each other, it\\'ll be good.\"\\nYurtaykin was born in Belovo, Russia, a city with a population of just over 70,000 located in Southwest Central Siberia. He played in the KHL the past two years, and had 19 points in 40 games with Yaroslavl Locomotiv last season.\\nWhen the Sharks first signed Yurtaykin to a two-year, entry-level contract in April, he was described by general manager Doug Wilson in a team news release as an \"explosive skater who uses his speed to create and sustain production in the offensive zone.\"\\nIn that respect, Yurtaykin has certainly come as advertised, showing flashes at the Sharks\\' development camp in June, the rookie tournament in Anaheim earlier this month and in three preseason games.\\nThursday against the Calgary Flames when the Sharks dressed nearly a complete NHL roster, Yurtaykin took one minor penalty for high-sticking and had three shots on goal in 14 minutes and 47 seconds of ice time. At even strength, he skated on a line with Thornton and Lukas Radil, and was also on the ice for four minutes of power play time.\\nYurtaykin still does not have a point in the exhibition season. But he\\'s still learning the system and getting used to his teammates.\\n\"We try to create our own language a little bit,\" Meier said. \"It\\'s definitely not easy for him. Radil speaks a little bit of Russian, (Evgeni Nabokov) helps him a lot with system stuff, with power play, breakouts. We\\'ve got some funny words we use. Just try and make it as easy as possible.\"\\nRadil spent three seasons in the KHL, and has tried to help Yurtaykin with the transition into the new environment.\\n\"I try to use my Russian words to help him a little bit,\" Radil said.\\nThe question the Sharks still have is whether he can be consistent at both ends of the ice and thereby gain the trust of the coaching staff to stick around.\\n\"I don\\'t know if you have a good handle on any of the new guys\\' game five games into exhibition,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said.\\nYurtaykin was one of several free agents the Sharks signed in the offseason, as the team also gave contracts to forwards Lean Bergmann and Joel Kellman, defenseman Tony Sund and goalie Andrew Shortridge. Bergmann looks like another rookie who will start the season in the NHL, while Kellman and Shortridge were reassigned to the Barracuda earlier in camp and Tony Sund was returned to TPS Turku of SM-liiga.\\nFor years, the Sharks have successfully mined European leagues for impactful free agents, with Radil, Sorensen, Radim Simek and Melker Karlsson all part of the team this season.\\nMaybe the Sharks have found another keeper in Yurtaykin. That\\'s something they still have to figure out.\\n\"I think the more you practice with him, the speed and skill are obvious,\" DeBoer said. \"Whether that translates to production in NHL games is the question. Until you start getting him in games, a handful of games and see that, you don\\'t know.\"\\n(c)2019 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.A PROFESSIONAL gambler is reportedly suing one of London\\'s leading hotels after he says it allowed a bankrupt businessman to take four classic cars he agreed to buy but never paid for.\\nThe Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane, Mayfair, is accused of allowing the unnamed man to remove the cars - which include a Mercedes-Benz Pullman owned by the last Shah of Iran - from its garage, The Sunday Times reports.

Taking advantage of the vast sea of flowers that form part of the Xinghua Duotian Agrosystem, Xinghua launched an initiative calling for enhanced international exchanges and economic cooperation with the lavender gardens of Provence, cherry blossoms of Tokyo and tulip gardens of the Netherlands, with the aim of achieving financially win-win results based on further development of destinations known for their flowers around the world.\\nRepresentatives from French, Dutch and Japanese tourism organizations operating in China respectively expressed their support for the initiative and intent to join in the collaboration. Chinese tourism service providers including Tongcheng Tourism, Ctrip, Tuniu and Lvmama said they would contribute their advantages in resources and channels to facilitate the development of an \"industry cluster\" based on the flower fields and related tours.\\nThe integration of culture and tourism is based on a profound cultural heritage. Xinghua is home to 92 historical and cultural sites, among which, three are key state-level sites, 12 are at the provincial level and 77 are at the county level. The town is also home to 124 projects directly related to the conservation of intangible cultural heritage, among them, the Maoshan haozi (a style of folk song performed to synchronized movements), Moashan boat racing and Zhuhong Town wooden boats. Xinghua has also been the birthplace of many of China\\'s luminaries over the centuries, including 14th century writer Shi Nai\\'an, 18th century painter Zheng Banqiao, 19th century Qing Dynasty scholar-official Liu Xizai, novelist Bi Feiyu, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge chief architect Lin Ming and leading hematologist and Medical School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University tenured professor Wang Zhenyi.\\nXinghua party secretary Li Weiguo said during his presentation on the unique characteristics of Xinghua: \"Xinghua is a city featuring abundant water resources. Serving as a model for the country\\'s ecological protection on a nationwide scale, the city is becoming a national model for ecological and cultural development. Xinghua is well-known across China for its \"seas of flowers\" and beautiful natural scenery. The city boasts a profound cultural heritage and positive educational environment. Its strong position in terms of environmental protection coupled with the deep heritage paves the way for the prosperous development of the city\\'s tourism industry.\\nView original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chinas-xinghua-boosts-development-of-rural-lifestyle-themed-tourism-offerings-300943619.html\\nSOURCE Culture, Sports, Radio, Television and Tourism Bureau of Xinghua TaizhouZomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp (TSX-V:ZOM) Shares Issued 108,038,398 Last Close 11/11/2019 $0.45 Tuesday November 12 2019 - News Release\\nZOMEDICA ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS\\nZomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. has released its consolidated financial results for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 2019.

Its 11 wins are tied for the most in the league.\\n\"It\\'s very important because this is our home,\" Hector Villalba said. \"We have to make this a tough place to play. Last season we were ale to do that. We have to keep defending this stadium.\"\\nAtlanta United is currently second in the East with 54 points. It has two more points than Philadelphia, which will play on Sunday at New York Red Bulls. Atlanta United trails first-place NYCFC by six points. It will play at Dallas on Sunday.\\nThe team that finishes in first in the East gets a bye in the first round of the playoffs and home-field advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.\\nThe second-place team will get to host playoff games in the first and second rounds, at least.\\nIf the playoffs started today, Atlanta United would host New England in the first round. Should it win, it would host the winner of the game between the current fourth-seeded New York Red Bulls and third-seeded Philadelphia.\\nAtlanta United can still finish in first. It would likely need to win its remaining three games, which start on Wednesday at NYCFC. Atlanta United will play at Montreal and host New England in the finale.\\nThat positioning is why the two late goals scored on Saturday to defeat San Jose were so important.\\n\"I think that is the kind of mentality we need to have going forward, is to try and win all these games, and give us the best position in the playoffs,\" said Emerson Hyndman, who scored the winning goal. \"The better position, the easier it could be, so every game is important.\" -- Southern Fried Soccer Podcasts:\\nCan be found on I-tunes and Spreaker\\nFor more content about Atlanta United:\\nFollow me on twitter @DougRobersonAJC\\nOn Facebook at Atlanta United News Now\\nAtlanta United coverage on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution\\nHave a question?

The Company earned adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, accretion on asset retirement obligations, non-operating expenses, and development costs (‘adjusted EBITDA\") of a loss of $2.67 million in the third quarter of 2019, as compared with adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.99 million for the third quarter of 2018. Revenues totaled $1.85 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 versus $9.04 million in the prior-year quarter.\\n\"We are extremely excited about how our platform is set up to perform in 2020 and beyond. The third quarter of 2019 proved to be a challenging quarter for our industry, highlighted by a number of market participants liquidating assets through the bankruptcy process in the face of the seasonal steel slowdown and general macro uncertainties in the global economy. During this period, we were able to execute on both organic opportunities as well as opportunities to further consolidate quality metallurgical carbon assets,\" stated Mark Jensen, Chairman and CEO of American Resources Corporation. \"Organically, we took the opportunity to further develop some of our existing mines around our McCoy Elkhorn complex including commencing the final development stage to bring our Carnegie 2 mine into production. The capital investments and development of our mines meant that we needed to take some production offline. We feel that this was done at an opportune time and has put us in a better position in terms of volume and quality metrics. We were also very active in the bankruptcy processes of assets within our operating region. As a result, we were able to acquire our previously announces, fifth operating complex, Perry County Resources this past September. The addition of Perry County to our portfolio of assets is already proving to be a valuable assets as we are executing on our restructuring plan while serving the existing customer base. Overall, the market for our products remains very promising as the world\\'s need for carbon, steel and infrastructure continues to be healthy, and our platform remains in a unique position of bringing a robust pipeline of growth to the market and to our investors.\"\\nThe Company produced and sold 25,969 short tons of coal in the third quarter of 2019.\\nThe exhibit below summarizes some of the key sales, production and financial metrics:\\n(c) Cash cost per ton is based on reported cost of sales and includes items such as production taxes, royalties, labor, fuel, and other similar production and sales cost items, and may be adjusted for other items that, pursuant to GAAP, are classified in the Statement of Operations as costs other than cost of sales, but relate directly to the cost incurred to produce coal. Our cash cost of sales per short ton is calculated as cash cost of sales divided by short tons sold, and our cash margin per ton is calculated by subtracting cash cost per ton from revenue per ton. Cash cost of sales per short ton and average cash margin per ton are non-GAAP financial measure which are calculated in conformity with U.S. GAAP and should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with GAAP. We believe cash cost of sales per ton and average cash margin per ton are useful measurse of performance as it aides some investors and analysts in comparing us against other companies. Cash cost of sales per ton and margin per ton may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\\nMark Jensen added, \"Throughout the third quarter of 2019, where we idled some production during a time of market softness, we also continued to make progress on our growth objectives to position ourselves for advancement in 2020. Most notably, was the acquisition of Perry County Resources, as it represents our fifth carbon processing and logistics hub in the Central Appalachian basin and broadens our footprint in the metallurgical carbon market. Additionally, we continued to position our metallurgical mines at McCoy Elkhorn to provide expanded output with greater efficiencies. Over the past five months, we have seen a meaningful amount of U.S. carbon supply come offline given market participants idling assets plus several participants entering into bankruptcy. Our unique business model has allowed us to be opportunistic during this time and strengthen our position in the market. We expect markets to firm up sometime next year as it digests a tighter supply outlook, while our outlook on demand remains healthy. We feel that we are in as good of a position as we have ever been to deliver attractive growth to our customers, employees and shareholders, and we maintain a sanguine outlook on carbon and steel markets given infrastructure development world-wide.\"\\nTotal revenues were $1,847,969 for the third quarter of 2019.

The other 30% is already contracted to the Middleton-Cross Plains School District and the city of Middleton.\\n\"We knew this would be popular ... and it certainly has been,\" said Commissioner Mike Huebsch. \"It\\'s proven to be beneficial to customers.\"\\nRenewable energy advocates generally supported the program but objected to MGE\\'s rate structure, which includes a 2.5-cent charge for use of the electrical grid but does not compensate customers for the benefits the solar panels provide to the system.\\nThe commission voted unanimously to allow Alliant Energy to build community solar gardens where residential customers could buy panels at around $1,200 per kilowatt and the utility would pay residential customers at least 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour generated.\\nRecognizing the popularity of the community solar program, the PSC capped the program at 6 megawatts -- twice what Alliant had requested.\\nUnder a companion program, Alliant will be allowed to develop up to 150 megawatts of new solar projects in partnership with commercial and industrial customers.\\nOver objections from Chairwoman Rebecca Valcq, the commission approved another Alliant proposal to install solar panels on customer property.\\nThe program, in which customers receive lease payments based on the amount of energy generated, is similar to one approved last year for We Energies.\\nRenewable energy and ratepayer advocates have opposed such \"rent-a-roof\" programs, which they say are a bad deal for customers and unfair to private developers.\\nUtilities have sought to block third-party companies from offering similar lease arrangement, arguing that only regulated entities can supply electricity. The PSC has so far refused to rule whether third-party leases are legal.\\n\"Where does the monopoly end and the private market begin? It doesn\\'t appear there\\'s any guard rails,\" said Tyler Huebner, executive director of Renew Wisconsin. \"The commission has yet to determine if outside entities can offer these leases. It sets up this uneven playing field.\"\\nValcq appeared to agree with that reasoning.\\n\"I view this as sort of the monopolies using their position to elbow out the competition,\" Valcq said. \"I see this as sort of stifling that market.\"\\nThe commission capped Alliant\\'s program to install solar panels on customer property at 20 megawatts -- 15 less than the company requested -- noting that Alliant had not identified a need for additional capacity.\\nAlliant spokesman Scott Reigstad praised the commission\\'s decisions.\\n\"Our customers are asking more and more for new and additional opportunities to partner with us on renewables,\" he said. \"We now have the opportunity to expand upon those renewable offerings, both to our customers and the communities we serve.\"\\nFirst introduced in 2016, MGE\\'s Shared Solar program quickly sold out, with 285 customers volunteering to initially increase their monthly bills in order to support the utility\\'s first foray into solar energy.\\nThat resulted in the installation of solar panels on Middleton\\'s public works Operations Center that generate about 640,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year -- enough to power about 100 typical Madison households.\\nUnder the expansion, known as Shared Solar 2.0, customers will pay an up-front fee of $47.25 per share. Each share is expected to produce about 325 kilowatt-hours per year, which is roughly 3% of the typical Wisconsin household consumption.\\nCustomers in the program agree to pay 10.9 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. That\\'s about a penny more than the current residential rate, but it\\'s locked in for 25 years, providing users a hedge against rising rates.\\nCustomers who bought into the original pilot at 12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour will automatically qualify for the lower rate.\\nConstruction is expected to begin this summer. Customers may visit mge.com/sharedsolar to enroll.\\nDespite objections to some aspects of the programs, Huebner noted they could result in the addition of nearly 180 megawatts of new solar capacity -- nearly twice what was in place at the end of last year.\\n\"The commission approved a substantial tranche of renewable energy potential today,\" he said. \\'It does create more of a runway for development of renewable energy in Wisconsin.\"\\n(c)2019 The Wisconsin State Journal (Madison, Wis.)\\nVisit The Wisconsin State Journal (Madison, Wis.) at www.wisconsinstatejournal.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.If you thought that Guy Ritchie would bring no small amount of grit to the fairy-tale world of Disney, you\\'d be mistaken. His Aladdin, the latest in a series of Mouse House remakes, is a big-hearted fantasy musical with a gorgeous colour palette and a strict moral code that tries very hard - but doesn\\'t quite succeed - to improve on the studio\\'s 1992 version.\\nThat film, which helped to reverse Disney\\'s ailing fortunes, brought a slick new sensibility to animated films and is remembered largely for Robin Williams\\'s hellzapoppin\\' vocal performance as the Genie, summoned from the lamp to grant three wishes to raffish street urchin Aladdin. Will Smith, now in the role, does a terrific job in bringing his own brand of manic chutzpah to the part, offering some much-needed amplification to a film that finds itself in danger of being lost in its over-prettified storytelling.\\nYes, I know it\\'s a fantasy, but Ritchie\\'s attempt at Muslim chic is troubling. A sanitised souk is carpeted with rose petals; Aladdin agrees a rendezvous with Princess Jasmine \"when the moon rises above the minaret\". More perplexing still is the odd array of accents. Mena Massoud\\'s Aladdin sounds a little too Ivy Leagueish for someone so poor; a dour and unsympathetic market trader has a voice of \"otherness\" that comes from central casting. Arch baddie Jafar (Marwan Kenzari) speaks with a generic European accent that you used to find on the dubbing of Eurotrash.\\nIt is Jafar who orders Aladdin to bring him the lamp from the Cave of Wonders so he can wish to be sultan. Jafar, like our hero, came from nothing. However, his ambition to join the ruling classes smacks of nouveauriche pushiness (and he must, therefore, be punished!), whereas Aladdin just wants to live happily ever after with his love, Princess Jasmine.\\nWhile Massoud\\'s performance is more endearing than thrilling, at least Naomi Scott gets more to do as this thoroughly modern princess who sees no reason that a woman can\\'t be a ruler, and has a touching respect for her people, even if she is prone to the occasional lapse into psychobabble (\"You\\'re only as happy as your least happy subject\").\\nScott also gets the film\\'s best song (a new number called Speechless), which for a moment gives the film a new emotional register. But too often the well-loved musical numbers such as A Whole New World seem truncated and their power muted against the spectacular visuals and swift-footed action.\\nIn the last half of the film, Ritchie comes into his own and you can see those flashes of brilliance that made his astonishingly assured debut, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, feel so fresh and exciting 20 years ago.\\nUltimately, this is a rollicking adventure that will enchant young audiences. It\\'s just a shame that its odd creative missteps tend to linger in the memory once the magic has faded.\\nFilm Newsletter For more movie news and reviews, you can sign up to Robbie Collin\\'s weekly film newsletter by visiting telegraph.co.uk/ filmnewsletterFor insight into the federal corruption investigation snaking through Illinois’ political complex, look back to Dec. 1, 2016.\\nOn that final day of the legislature’s fall session, a team of lobbyists representing powerhouse utility company ComEd frantically pieced together a roll call of lawmakers willing to vote for an electricity rate hike on consumers. That’s no easy sell. The hike would cost up to $4.54 extra per month for ComEd customers, and bail out two nuclear power plants the company was threatening to shut down.\\nThe attorney general at the time, Lisa Madigan, whose father was muscling the measure through the House, had warned legislators against the bailout.\\n“It’s outrageous that Exelon and ComEd are again requesting a bailout when they are both profitable companies,” she wrote during the lead-up to the vote. “This proposal would force consumers to pay more only to boost the companies’ profits further. The legislature has more important matters to address than padding ComEd and Exelon’s profits.”\\nBut ComEd was not deterred. It had the ear of the other Madigan. The one who mattered.\\nComEd’s lobbyists also had wined and dined lawmakers, often in groups of five or six, at Springfield’s upscale restaurants. They had sprinkled campaign donations to key legislators, attended their golf outings and made lists of their grandchildren’s names to be sure to ask how they were doing.\\nComEd provided lawmakers with talking points about preserving jobs at the threatened nuclear plants in the Quad Cities and Clinton. And of course, the company had hired a team of consultants whom lawmakers trusted: former colleagues, retired politicians and their friends and family members. That is how the game is played.\\nThe company’s public relations spin had morphed a controversial rate hike into a pro-environment, pro-union, pro-business measure. ComEd had the AFL-CIO on its side, green energy groups, retailers and even African American ministers who could sway the Legislative Black Caucus. And of course as we now know, ComEd had one of House Speaker Michael Madigan’s confidants, Mike McClain, whispering in his ear.\\nKeep in mind that Illinois on Dec. 1, 2016, had no annual budget in place. Yet during that fall veto session, legislative leaders spent almost no time trying to resolve a standoff that was forcing social service agencies to close, starving state universities, freezing tuition payments for low-income college students and causing the state’s unpaid bills to climb toward $8.5 billion.\\nThat didn’t get leaders’ heads to turn. But ComEd did.\\n“The whole day was bad. It was dirty, and I felt like I needed a shower driving home. I was literally crying at how ridiculous the process was,” said Rep. Mark Batinick, R-Plainfield, on Wednesday. He broke down in tears on the ride back home. The state was utterly, completely broken.\\nBatinick and Rep. Tom Morrison, R-Palatine, had tried to slow down the bill as it wound through the amendment and committee process. But in the end, ComEd was able to entice even self-proclaimed progressives -- the ones who moan and groan about corporate subsidies and multimillion-dollar profits -- to support the bill. Yes, I’m looking at you, Rep. Will Guzzardi, D-Chicago.\\nGuzzardi was a “yes” vote along with Rep. John Bradley, D-Marion, who later went to work for ComEd. So was Rep. Michael Zalewski, D-Riverside, whose father has been linked to the wide-ranging federal probe and whose wife, Carrie Zalewski, now chairs the Illinois Commerce Commission, which oversees ComEd.\\nSen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, also linked to the federal investigation, voted for the bill, along with a crisscross of Republicans and Democrats.\\n“What are we doing, you guys? What are we doing listening to this bill?\" asked Rep. Sam Yingling, D-Grayslake, on the day of the House vote. “We don’t have a budget and our so-called stopgap budget is just weeks away from expiring. Instead, we are talking about a multibillion-dollar corporate bailout for one of the most profitable energy companies in the state. And how are we going to finance this? This is going to be financed on the back of the rate payers.”\\nStill, no one could stop the ComEd gravy train that day. You could almost hear the pop of Champagne corks in back offices of the Capitol as the legislation roared through both chambers. The feds heard it too -- the clink of crystal flutes, the congratulatory slaps on backs and shoulder blades, the scratch of pencils to paper as lawyers totaled up their billable hours.\\nIndeed. The feds heard a lot.\\nKristen McQueary is a member of the Tribune Editorial Board.\\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. ( USPH), announced today that the Company plans to increase its quarterly dividend and that it has sold a partnership interest.\\nU.S. Physical Therapy Raises Quarterly Dividend\\nIn March, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend of 17% from $.23 per share per quarter in 2018 to $.27 in 2019. Two quarterly dividends have been paid thus far this year at the $.27 rate. The Company plans to increase the third and fourth quarter dividends for 2019 by an additional 11% to $.30 per share. U.S. Physical Therapy began paying quarterly dividends in 2011 and has increased the dividend amount every year since as well as having paid a special dividend.\\nThe Company has sold its 50% interest in one physical therapy partnership to the group’s founders. The sales proceeds to U.S. Physical Therapy, all of which is in cash, is $11.6 million. There is an estimated $2.0 million pre-tax gain on the sale. Management does not anticipate any other sales of partnership interests. The practice historically had financially underperformed.\\nAbout U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc.\\nFounded in 1990, U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc. operates 565 outpatient physical therapy clinics in 41 states.

Larry McAfee, Chief Financial Officer Chris Reading, Chief Executive Officer (713) 297-7000\\nSource: U.S. Physical Therapy, Inc.Jul. 2--More than a decade ago, Los Angeles stopped putting people in jail for sleeping in the streets -- a compromise laid out in a court settlement that halted police enforcement of laws barring encampments in public spaces until the city could build more housing for homeless people.\\nThat 2007 settlement, commonly known as the Jones agreement, came the year after a ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found L.A.\\'s sweeps of homeless encampments on skid row were cruel and unusual punishment. Last September, in a case from Boise, Idaho, the same court issued a similar ruling, saying that prosecuting people for sleeping on the sidewalk when there are not enough shelter beds or housing was unconstitutional.\\nThe latter ruling turned what was supposed to be a stopgap arrangement in L.A. into a sweeping and potentially open-ended curb on police powers in nine Western states, including in California, where an affordable housing shortage and an explosion of homelessness has made providing sufficient shelter a tough -- if not impossible -- proposition.\\nNow, Theodore B. Olson, a conservative legal hero who has argued 63 times before the U.S. Supreme Court, has launched an appeal that could restore L.A.\\'s authority to clear street encampments at night -- and reverse the city\\'s gradual shift toward decriminalizing homelessness and liberalizing its policies.\\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court granted Olson and fellow attorney Theane Evangelis an extension to ask the justices to take up the case, Martin vs. City of Boise -- the first step in an appeal.\\nThe attorneys, both with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a powerhouse law firm with offices in L.A., cited the \"urgent crisis and the public health challenge\" of burgeoning encampments. They argue the shantytowns trap homeless people in dangerous conditions that keep them from seeking shelter and services.\\nEric Tars, legal director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, said it was \"disingenuous\" to argue that cities can\\'t help people in camps, or that homeless people won\\'t use shelters if they are clean, safe and available.\\nTars, who, working with another big law firm, Latham & Watkins, and Idaho Legal Aid Services brought the Boise case to the 9th Circuit on behalf of six homeless individuals, said punishing homeless people for sleeping outdoors saddles them with arrest records and tickets they can\\'t pay that keep them from getting jobs and housing.\\nEvangelis, whose Los Angeles office is only blocks from downtown street encampments, said that, like most Angelenos, she had followed news on the homeless issue \"with interest\" before deciding that the case merited the court\\'s attention.\\n\"This is an important case that warrants Supreme Court review,\" she said, \"and I reached out to the city [of Boise] and offered our assistance.\"\\nMike Journee, a spokesman for Boise, said several law firms approached the city offering to file an appeal. But Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher put forward a \"great deal\" -- a flat fee of about $300,000, which is far below the firm\\'s usual rates. The attorneys also demonstrated interest and experience in the subject matter, he said.\\nThe high court typically only takes 70 of 9,000 appeal requests a year, according to Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of law at UC Berkeley. And it\\'s unclear if the justices will hear this case.\\nIn April 2019, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did refuse to reconsider the Boise ruling. But in an unusual dissent, Judge Milan Smith Jr. said the opinion broke with precedent for the U.S. Supreme Court and other appellate courts -- a clear invitation to the high court to step in, legal experts said.\\nOlson, who served as solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, brings decades of experience before the court, as well as sterling conservative and legal credentials that match those of a majority of the high court\\'s justices.\\nIn Bush v. Gore, he persuaded the justices to drop a recount of ballots in Florida, putting the Republican candidate in the White House. In one of the cases involving Citizens United, he helped strike down special interest campaign financing limits, and spoke out against former President Bill Clinton, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.\\nMore recently, with attorney David Boies in Obergefell v. Hodges, he led the Supreme Court battle to legalize same-sex marriage, upsetting some of his conservative allies.\\nEvangelis briefly advised the Central City Assoc. earlier this year on a matter related to homelessness. But Jessica Lall, chief executive of the downtown L.A. business group, which generally supports curbing encampments, said it is not financing or taking part in the appeal.\\nChemerinsky, who also is a prominent constitutional scholar, said he doubts the Supreme Court will take up the Boise case.\\n\"The 9th Circuit got it right,\" he said. \"A city can\\'t make it a crime to be a homeless person.\"\\nIn his dissent, Smith, who was joined by five judges on the 9th Circuit, said that the Boise ruling had begun \"wreaking havoc\" on local government, and predicted that it would lead to dropping laws against public defecation and urination and force cities into ruinous investments in shelters or housing.\\nSmith put a photograph of sidewalk tents on a downtown Los Angeles street into the record, asserting that the Boise decision \"shackles the hands of public officials trying to redress the serious societal concern of homelessness.\"\\nJudge Marsha Berzon, who wrote the original decision in the case, objected to Smith\\'s inclusion of the photo as outside the scope of the case and said his dissent was a \"distorted presentation of the issues.\" She called the ruling \"narrow\" and said the court wasn\\'t telling cities how to deal with their camps, but rather to stop prosecuting unsheltered people who have no alternatives.\\nSince the Jones settlement in 2007, the spread of encampments has pushed homelessness to the top of L.A.\\'s political agenda, driving cleanup costs above $40 million a year, and drawing officials into fractious debates over hygiene and public health and legal disputes over confiscating and destroying homeless people\\'s property.\\nIn June, several L.A. city councilmen accused neighboring suburbs of pushing homeless camps into their jurisdiction, and city sanitation officials laid out a plan to overhaul the way L.A. cleans up the camps.\\nTo get out of the Jones settlement, Chemerinsky said, L.A. would still have to show it has built the requisite housing, split between downtown and the rest of the city. Advocates already are lining up to dispute that new housing the city has already built fits the bill.\\nTars said some cities, including Modesto, are responding constructively to the Boise decision, opening shelters and designated areas for homeless people to camp.\\n\"It\\'s not a perfect option, but for a place like L.A., it may be necessary as an interim step,\" he said.\\nThe petition to the U.S. Supreme Court is due Aug. 29, with a decision from the court on whether to hear the appeal is expected no sooner than October, according to the city of Boise.\\n(c)2019 the Los Angeles Times\\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.SAN MATEO, Calif.

He was so locked into the process that he didn\\'t realize how many he made until he marked them down on his card.\\nLocked in a tight race, Kelly ran off five straight birdies to close out the front nine and then made an insurance birdie late that carried him to a 7-under 65 and a one-shot victory in the final regular-season event on the PGA Tour Champions.\\n\"When the guys are so close and you\\'re bunched up, it\\'s make the next birdie,\" Kelly said. \"And then somebody else makes a birdie and it\\'s like, \\'OK, I have to make another birdie. I have to make another birdie.\\' It kind of shocked me to see I was three, four shots clear.\"\\nKelly made his lone bogey on the final hole when it only affected the margin. He won by one shot over David McKenzie, who shot 63.\\nWoody Austin and Doug Barron, who shared the lead going into the final round, each shot 71 and tied for third with David Toms (66). Barron fell back with a tee shot that went out-of-bounds on No. 6 and led to triple bogey. Austin played his final 13 holes in even par.\\nKelly, who finished at 16-under 200, won for the third time this year on the PGA Tour Champions and takes plenty of momentum into the postseason. He went over $2 million in earnings for the year and remains No. 2 in the Charles Schwab Cup standings, though he cut into Scott McCarron\\'s once big lead.\\nKelly now is $221,430 behind McCarron, and points are double in the three Schwab Cup playoff events that start in two weeks.\\n\"I\\'m very happy to be healthy, very happy to be playing well at this time,\" Kelly said.\\nRod Pampling of Australia, who turned 50 last month and was playing his second event on the PGA Tour Champions, needed to finish in the top 10 to earn a \"wild card\" into the postseason. He birdied three straight holes and needed one more on the 18th to finish the tournament in the top 10, but his 15-foot putt was inches short.\\nThe top 72 on the money list qualify for the postseason.\\nSandy Lyle was holding down the 72nd spot until closing with a 75. Mike Goodes, who started the SAS Championship with a 75, rallied with rounds of 68-70 and tied for 28th, making enough money to finish No. 72 on the money list by $323 over Lyle.(Alliance News) - Keras Resources PLC is to distribute its stake in Calidus Resources Ltd, worth over GBP11 million, to shareholders by the end of 2019, it said Tuesday.\\nAn escrow period for Keras\\' shares in Australia-listed miner Calidus has expired, Keras said, meaning the shares it holds can now trade without restriction in Sydney.\\nCalidus is expected to publish a pre-feasibility study for the Warrawoona gold project in Pilbara, Western Australia, in July, and following this 265 million performance shares will be issued to Keras.\\nThis will mean it holds 724 million Calidus shares, worth around GBP11.6 million. These will be distributed to Keras shareholders via a capital reduction and demerger, Keras said.\\nNot including the new performance shares, Keras holds 32% of Calidus.\\nChief Executive Russell Lamming commented: \"The proposed distribution of Calidus shares unlocks significant shareholder value in a somewhat unusual circumstance where we plan to distribute approximately GBP11.6 million worth of Calidus shares to our shareholders from Keras, which has a market capitalisation of circa GBP8.6 million.\\n\"In addition, each shareholder will still retain their current shareholding in Keras with direct exposure to the Nayega manganese project that post-exploitation permit approval has installed production capacity to produce 75,000 tonnes of beneficiated manganese ore per year.\"\\n\"Our current proposal to distribute the Calidus shares will reward shareholders and allow us to be recognised and valued as a pure manganese play, which is unique on the London markets,\" Lamming continued.\\n\"The long-term demand fundamentals for manganese are strong and we believe that Nayega is an excellent platform from which to execute our growth strategy. I look forward to updating the market on developments in due course.\"\\nKeras, aside from Calidus, holds an 85% interest in the Nayega manganese project in northern Togo, which currently has a mineral resource of just under 14.0 million tonnes at a grade of 12% manganese.\\nKeras shares were 3.4% higher on Tuesday morning in London at 0.39 pence each.Dec. 10--FRANKFORT -- Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear signed an executive order Tuesday in his first day in office to create a new state school board. The displaced board members promptly said they would file a lawsuit.\\nHe said in the order that the board appointed by former Gov. Matt Bevin has conflicting relationships, a lack of experience in education and did not conduct a nationwide search in 2018 when it hired current Commissioner Wayne Lewis shortly after Bevin appointed seven new members.\\nBeshear has said for weeks he would act quickly when he took office to dismiss Lewis and the state Board of Education. He made the announcement about the reorganized board in his inaugural speech Tuesday afternoon.\\n\"This morning, I reorganized the state board of education and appointed new members who support public education,\" Beshear said to loud applause.\\nHe added, \"These members were not chosen based on any partisan affiliation, but based on their commitment to make our schools better, to put our children first.\"\\nShortly after the announcement, the old board members said they would sue, and challenged his attempt to remove them before their terms expire.\\n\"We strongly feel that this action by the governor is of questionable legality and must be tested in the courts,\" said state board member Gary Houchens, one of those displaced. \"Unlike other Kentucky government boards, the make-up of the KBE is governed by the Kentucky Education Reform Act, which provides a clear process for a new governor to appoint new members to the KBE on a staggered basis, every two years. Board members today are seeking to set aside the governor\\'s order and allow an orderly transition of board control over a two year period, as intended by the\" Kentucky Education Reform Act.\\nEddie Campbell, president of the Kentucky Education Association, which backed Beshear\\'s campaign, said, \"The KEA supports Gov. Beshear\\'s decision to reconstitute the Kentucky Board of Education.\\n\"Under the previous administration, board appointees were based more on political pedigree than on their experience and knowledge of educational issues. We have confidence that the Beshear administration will make appointments based on merit, and choose board members who possess a foundational understanding of the challenges facing public education in the Commonwealth.\"\\nCampbell said, \"The students of Kentucky deserve a board of education that works for the improvement of public education and not for partisan purposes.\"\\nThe Kentucky School Boards Association said in a statement that the organization looks forward to engaging with Beshear\\'s appointees to the Kentucky Board of Education. \"Our association stands ready to work with our state\\'s elected and appointed leaders to advance public education on behalf of each and every student in Kentucky,\" it said.\\nOne board member, Amanda Stamper, a former spokesperson for Bevin, opted out of the lawsuit which was expected to be filed Tuesday night in Franklin Circuit Court, but Bart Greenwald, the attorney representing the board members, said he did not know why.\\nBeshear named David Karem, a former lawmaker and state board member, as temporary chairman of the new board.\\nHe also appointed Holly Bloodworth of Murray, 2014 Kentucky Teacher of the Year and instructor of elementary education program at Murray State University; retired teacher Patrice McCrary of Bowling Green; Middlesboro attorney and former state Rep. Mike Bowling; Sharon Porter Robinson of Louisville, a former assistant secretary of the U.S Department of Education; Lu Young of Nicholasville, former Jessamine County schools superintendent; former University of Kentucky President Lee Todd of Lexington; former state Sen. David Karem of Louisville; Claire Batt of Lexington, an elementary school teacher; Alvis Johnson of Harrodsburg, the 1996 runnerup for Walt Disney Teacher of the Year and former UK assistant athletic director; JoAnn Adams of Pleasureville; and Cody Pauley Johnson of Pikeville.\\nRecords with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance show that Robinson gave $250 to Beshear\\'s campaign, Adams gave $140, Johnson $3,000, Todd $4,000, Karem $2,500, and Batt $350.\\nBeshear appointed Rowan County teacher Allison Slone as a non-voting member.\\nAmong other things, Beshear\\'s order said the old board members accepted plane tickets, hotel rooms and conference fees from an organization closely tied to registered lobbyists of both the Kentucky Department of Education and the Kentucky Board of Education.\\nRich Gimmel, one of the removed board members said Tuesday that the matter would be addressed in the lawsuit. Gimmel said he wasn\\'t in the group that attended the conference in question but \"my understanding was that it passed an ethics test before the meeting was scheduled.\"\\nElected to office with strong support of many teachers who are not fond of Lewis and the state education board members appointed by Bevin, Beshear had said previously that his executive order would create an entirely new education board. It, in turn, would dismiss Lewis and begin a national search for a new education commissioner, Beshear has said.\\nLewis and several members of the old board had voiced support for charter schools that would receive state funding but operate independently of the established state school system. Some educators fear they would take money from public schools.\\nLewis said he would begin communicating with the newly appointed members Tuesday night about the work of the board and the state department of education.\\n\"Almost 650,000 students will walk into a Kentucky public school tomorrow. Every single instructional day matters for them,\" Lewis said. \"Regardless of what is happening politically, our focus should remain on them.\"\\nHouchens said in a news release Tuesday that the only rationale Governor Beshear has given for the removal is that \"many of us believe Kentucky should join 44 other states and the Dis'"
